# rust-orm

    ``` sh
    cargo add diesel dotenv actix --features "diesel/postgres diesel/r2d2 diesel/chrono"

    ```

#### This line adds the diesel, dotenv, and actix crates to your project using cargo.
#### The --features flag specifies additional features for the diesel crate: diesel/postgres: Enables support for connecting to PostgreSQL databases. diesel/r2d2: Integrates Diesel with the r2d2 connection pool. diesel/chrono: Provides time-related functionality for Diesel models.


    ``` sh
    cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres

    ```

#### This line installs the diesel_cli binary separately from the diesel crate.--no-default-features: Excludes features that might not be needed (e.g., for compiling on unsupported platforms). --features postgres: Includes the PostgreSQL support for diesel_cli.


    ``` sh
    cargo install diesel_cli_ext

    ```

#### This installs the diesel_cli_ext crate, which likely provides additional functionality for the Diesel command-line interface (CLI).


    ``` sh
    diesel setup

    ```

#### This command runs the Diesel setup process, generating initial files for interacting with your database.


    ``` sh
    rm -r migrations
    ```

#### This line (assuming it's commented out) removes the migrations directory if it exists. Migrations are files used to manage schema changes in your database.


    ``` sh
    # $PSDefaultParameterValues['Out-File:Encoding'] = 'utf8'
    ```

    ``` sh
    diesel print-schema > src/schema.rs
    ```

#### This command uses the diesel_cli binary to generate Rust code representing your database schema. The output is saved to src/schema.rs.


    ``` sh
    diesel_ext > src/models.rs
    ```

#### This line (assuming diesel_ext is a custom command) might be generating code for your database models based on the schema or other information. The output is saved to src/db.rs.
